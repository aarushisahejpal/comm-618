RE: RECORDS REQUEST


Dear Records Officer:


This is a request under the California Public Records Act. Pursuant to that law, I request access to and copies
of the following records:

1. The total number of use of force incidents reported by the San Jose police department, separated
by year and by type of force used from 2017 - 2022. If possible, please provide the definitions of the different types of force.

2. A list of all officer involved shootings from 2017 - 2022. 

If only partial information is available responsive to one or more of these requests, please provide all
of the information that is available. The requested documents will be made available to the general public,
and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. In the event that there are fees, I would be
grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the
request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.


If my request is denied in whole or part, please justify all withholdings by reference to specific exemptions.
If you have questions regarding this request, please feel free to contact me. I look forward to your response
promptly but in any event within 10 days of receipt of this request.
Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Sincerely,
Aarushi Sahejpal
