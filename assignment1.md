### COMM-618, Spring 2023, Data-driven Journalism


Math and programming anxiety among journalists is widespread. 
Survey data from those participating in the Weekend COMM-618: Data Driven Journalism course at American University's School of Communication sheds light on
the already existing discourse surrounding the trepidations that many journalists have with the growing field of computer-assisted reporting and the introduction
of data science tools in the newsroom. 

The survey itself asks 8 individuals in the class, including the instructor, about their familiarity with many common data journalism tools such as:
* Freedom of Information Act requests
* programming tools such as SQL and Python
* code collaboration software like Github 

Students in the course were asked to respond to questions regarding their comfortability
with the latter topics on a scale of 0, representing unfamilarity, and 4, representing full fluency. 

When asked about knowledge surrounding version control systems and familiarty with programming languages, the average response for comfortability
was a 0.8. What's even more stark is the midpoint for the total responses regarding three questions about exposure to data tools data sits at 0. 
While the intersection of data science and journalism has expondentially grown in popularity, the results were at par with historic [industry-wide conversations](https://archives.cjr.org/behind_the_news/sorry_wrong_number.php)
surrounding the hesitations that journalists have with data-driven tools.

All but two respondents are journalism and communication students, with the two visible outliers being the instructor and a data science student. 
It's evident that, even with two individuals in the class scoring 3s and 4s in most categories, exposure to math and programming is low.
