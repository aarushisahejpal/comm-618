## Final Pitch, 2/4.   

The phenomenon of banned books has always fascinated me. On a broader scale, with the cultural shift of [censorship in Florida](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/01/us/college-board-advanced-placement-african-american-studies.html), there is a larger public service aspect of further investigating what states and administrations have pursued censorship of material over others.

Inspired by the last couple of assignments for this class, I would like to investigate the phenomenon of banning books in schools, classrooms, and educational settings around the country. While this has been sparsely reported [previously](https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/the-50-most-banned-books-in-america/2/), using the same data set below, the current political climate of education and learning being divided along partisan lines, warrants further study.

First, I would have to investigate some of the structural discrepancies between the books that are banned in certain states compared to others. Then, I want to stratify along party, governor, and timeframe. The goal is to attempt to relate certain bans to people, parties, and timeframes that certain individuals were at the helm of governance. Like most data stories I do, I always find something interesting when I take a further look at the information, but this is my starting and framing question.

The dataset I will be using to answer this question is the [PEN America's Index of School Book Bans dataset](https://pen.org/report/banned-usa-growing-movement-to-censor-books-in-schools/#:~:text=Banned%20Book%20Data%20Snapshot,affecting%201%2C648%20unique%20book%20titles.).
This dataset houses 2532 instances of book bans across 1648 different titles in the United States from July 2021 to June 2022. 

There is a detailed methodology section, with definitions for each of the values in the dataset, such as *book, primary author, secondary author, type of ban, and title*. In order to get a better context into what certain types of book bans mean and more information about the individual school districts that pursued this ban, I will cross reference with public documentation from schools and districts regarding these bans or challenges.

The information in this dataset was collected by the team at PEN America, who sourced and then made machine-readable, public records surrounding book challenges in each state, county, city, and school district to see what books were banned, and then further corroborated those bans with employees and officials at the respective schools. 

One limitation to this set could be that, because this dataset was individually and hand sourced using press releases and news stories that were made public, there could have been some bans that just were not released through traditional challenges. I assume I will also encounter more limitations but, my data vetting and check process is driven by the [ProPublica Guide to Bulletproofing Your Data](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/education/fl-ne-broward-schools-book-bans-20221103-rkypgfhjpzemdepfaimaxs2rmm-story.html)

It is important to acknowledge that PEN America is an advocacy group. Before this story could go to print, I need to be extremely detailed in my vetting process. During preliminary screening, I feel confident that this data set can be used because, although this group is an advocacy group, they seem to be an arbitrary middle-party that did the work to compile all of this public information into one location.


As a further data vetting procedure, I will and have started to cross-check these bans with official reports coming out of school districts. To start, I did a spot check of all of the book challenges in Broward County Public Schools in Florida with reports from the school districts and [news articles](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/education/fl-ne-broward-schools-book-bans-20221103-rkypgfhjpzemdepfaimaxs2rmm-story.html) discussing the challenge.
