## Assignment 1.1, 1/28
## Data Story Critique

For this week's data story critique, I chose [Why Would Prisons Ban My Book? Absurdities Rule the System](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/12/21/prison-banned-books-new-york-florida-censorship)
by [Keri Blakinger](https://www.themarshallproject.org/staff/keri-blakinger) of [The Marshall Project](https://www.themarshallproject.org/?ref=nav). 
This piece investigates the phenomenon and widespread banning of certain materials and books in prisons and jails across the United States, 
more specifically through the lens of Blakinger's own experience being in prison and unable to access certain books in a jail in New York. 
Citing the book she wrote even being banned in prisons in Florida, her and the Marshall Project staff, using a constructed dataset of banned titles in 18 states acquired from record requests.

This story was interesting because it deep dived into the nuances of constructing a data set from public record requests. While they didn’t link the source for each of the state’s information, the authors made it clear that they had to file individual requests from states to access this information. 

I liked this story because it used an anecdote of one individual’s experiences behind bars to explore a widespread phenomenon and a puzzle surrounding what books were banned in certain places and what books were not banned. The article briefly mentions that there are structural discrepancies between what titles are banned in certain states over others, so I think that is where I would take the coverage from here.
