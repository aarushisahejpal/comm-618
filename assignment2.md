## Assignment 2, 1/28.   
## Questions & (start to) answer

Inspired by Assignment 1.1, I would like to investigate further the phenomen of banning books in schools, classrooms, and educational settings around the country.
A more specific question would be: what are some of the structural discrepencies between the books that are banned in certain states compared to others?

I would like to further research the puzzle of individual state and local municipalities banning certain titles and books in classrooms and libraries, while comparing to see if those bans are consistent or dichotomous among different states.
In order to answer this question, I will be using [PEN America's Index of School Book Bans dataset](https://pen.org/report/banned-usa-growing-movement-to-censor-books-in-schools/#:~:text=Banned%20Book%20Data%20Snapshot,affecting%201%2C648%20unique%20book%20titles.)
This dataset houses 2532 instances of book bans across 1648 different titles in the United States from July 2021 to June 2022. 
When evaluating if this dataset was satisfactory and good enough to use, I first investigated see if the methodology section was well constructed and consistently defined. The index itself has definitions for each of the values in the dataset, such as *book, primary author, secondary author, and title*.
The information in this dataset was collected by the team at PEN America pouring through open-source information from each state, county, and city to see what books were banned, and then further corroborated those bans with employees at schools. One limitation to this set could be that, because this dataset was individually and hand sourced using press releases and news stories that were made public, there could have been some bans that just were not released through traditional challenges. While it seems like the methodology is robust enough to account for all possible permutations and combinations, it is important to keep what the dataset might not tell you in mind.
I still feel confident in this data set because the team also defined what how each specific type of ban and challenge would be considered, which gives important context to the number of times a book might be banned and the type of setting that it was banned in. 
I also went a bit further to investigate the background into PEN America, an organization that aims at making information surrounding freedom to write challenges public. I also dove into other reputable places that used this dataset for stories and analysis.
