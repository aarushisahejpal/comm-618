## Assignment 4.2
Chat GPT, and other AI-centered writing programs, have been up for debate, especially around its use as a tool in college classrooms. While some universities have staunchly written university-wide policies labeling it as a flagrant violation of academic integrity, other professors and academics are now implementing assignments and projects centered around its use. 
This dichotomy showcases a need for a dataset of official university-wide policies surrounding the use of Chat GPT in the classroom, and whether or not the institution considers it as a violation of academic integrity. This dataset could lead to a story addressing truly what universities are feeling surrounding the use of artificial intelligence in the classroom because this dataset is unprecedented, and we currently do not have a full view of what many universities are saying across the United States, just small anecdotal examples. 

### Data-points and variables of interest:
- Name of University
- R1 or R2 School
- Location
- Source/press release indicating policy surrounding Chat GPT
- Text of official policy
- Violation of academic integrity or not:
1. must be allowed by all professors
2. violation
3. up to discretion of professors

Data collection is driven through brute force google searches or contacting the individual university academic integrity centers, or relevant contacts, for official statements regarding their university-wide policy on Chat GPT or other AI platforms in classroom settings. There is an order system of preference for the methodology for this data collection. If the first option is not available for data collection, then the collection methodology is deferred to the section option and so forth:
1. Official university documentation / press release that indicates specific wording surrounding whether or not Chat GPT is allowed in the classroom
2. A phone-call or email documentation from official university source that indicates specific wording surrounding whether or not Chat GPT is allowed in the classroom 
3. Newspaper or journal article indicating that professors are allowed to decide their own specific academic policies surrounding Chat GPT for their classrooms, indicating institutions are deferring to professors to make their own decisions

If you want to forbid using AI tools, be explicit about this on your syllabus, as with this one here. If you allow these tools but want them to be acknowledged (cited or referenced), explain that on your syllabus. See some approaches below or the policies linked here and consider including in your syllabus:                                                                                                                                                                                    |                               3 |

Instead, Tulane will leave it up to faculty to decide the rules in each class. Some professors have sought to stop students from using it. Others are exploring its values.

Incentivize the learning process, not just the product: Asking students to submit one final perfect paper for an A may increase the odds of cheating. Instead, provide points for behaviors and habits associated with learning such as articulating ideas, failing, improving, and reflecting on one’s learning. For essays, this may be outlining, drafting, reviewing, and revising, which are essential skills for students to develop in the thinking and writing process. |                               3 |
